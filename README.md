# CuerManager
A web interface and backend for managing round dance cueing sessions.

## Introduction

Choreographed ballroom dancing or more common [round dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_dance) is a variant of ballroom dancing with a leader or cuer
telling the dancers what to do next. This tool is my way of managing such cueing sessions.

## For developers

This project has a backend written in Rust using the Rocket web framework in the src directory. The frontend is 
based on React and is located in the ui folder.
